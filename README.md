# File-Encryption---AES-256-CBC-
Created a bash script that encrypts files using AES-256 CBC algorithm and OpenSSL library.
Unveiling a robust bash script that seamlessly encrypts files using the 
formidable AES-256 CBC algorithm and OpenSSL library, ensuring 
unparalleled data security.

This meticulously designed script leverages the cutting-edge AES-256 
cipher in CBC mode, an industry-leading symmetric-key algorithm, 
ensuring utmost confidentiality. OpenSSL integration fortifies security 
with comprehensive cryptographic primitives for secure key generation, 
encryption, and decryption.

A secure passphrase undergoes robust key derivation, mitigating weak 
keys. Embracing best practices, the script employs secure random number 
generation for the Initialization Vector (IV), enhancing encryption 
security. Error handling, input validation, and modular design 
principles ensure a seamless, secure, maintainable, and extensible 
solution.

The project highlights my learning curve in bash scripting and 
Cryptography.
